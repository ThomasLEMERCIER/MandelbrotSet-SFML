# MandelbrotSet-SFML
Exploration of the mandelbrot set using SFML library in C++.

## Description

This is a project in view of learning the SFML library and improve my overall C++ skills. It displays the Mandelbrot set and let you navigue inside it. There are different implementations to compute the Mandelbrot set and you can switch between each to see the differences in term of time speeed.

## Mandelbrot set

The Mandelbrot set is a complex set containing all the complex number c for which iterating f(z) = z * z + c from z = 0 does not diverge. More information about the Mandelbrot set can be found on the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).
